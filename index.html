      <h5 class="welcome_text">A little bit about me</h5>
      <p>I started knitting when I was about 13 years old. Founder of this hobby in my family was my grandmother. 
        She taught me everything from knitting a square to socks and gloves. In addition to that we had several knitting books and magazines 
        that I read from cover to cover multiple times. When google and youtube started hitting off - finding information became even easier 
        and I went wild! I started to look for more complicated patterns and stitches to try. I made close to a hundred of projects and now looking back, 
        I am a little bit sad that I didn't document or at least pictured them. But anyway, there is still much more to try! 
        In my knitting “career” I faced some obstacles and had numerous questions, how to do or even begin understanding patterns. 
        I am here to share my knowledge and collected wisdom with you.</p>
      <p>Knitting is one of my most relaxing and enjoyable hobbies. It helps to develop focus, clear your mind, 
        sometimes even meditate and all while creating something valuable. I personally think that a knitted gift is a very heartwarming and caring gesture. 
        But that is all about me, it is your turn now!</p>
